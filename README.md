# GridVisualizer

## Motivation behind GridVisualizer
Very Large Power Networks are extremely complex systems often spanning over 1000 buses at a time. Understanding, Interpreting and Visualizing them is a challenging and tedious process. The GridVisualizer project looks to make that process easier through a visualization tool for power networks. <br>

GridVisualizer is a web-based tool that is aimed at helping power system researchers to understand their network datasets and the results of their research.

### Technologies used:
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript and JQuery.
4. Frameworks - [D3](http://d3js.org/) and [PIXI](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js)
5. Other Libraries used - [RangeSlider] (http://rangeslider.js.org/) and [SlideReveal] (https://nnattawat.github.io/slideReveal/)<br>

### How it works
As this tool is created for the power network researchers it requires data to be passed with a specific type format. In case you need discuss the future scope of this project please contact me at 'aayush.gaur@gmail.com'. Please do note that the project is available under MIT license.
